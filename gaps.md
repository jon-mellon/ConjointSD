Gaps in the formal proof relative to the paper’s causal identification and [consistency](readable/jargon_consistency.md) claims
==========================================================================================

Lean entrypoint: [ConjointSD.lean](ConjointSD.lean)

1) Approximation-error bounds for the linear-in-terms model are not instantiated
   - Remaining gap: supply concrete approximation bounds (C, δ) or [variance](readable/jargon_variance.md) nonnegativity needed to apply the approximation lemmas.
   - Empirical bound sketch (not formalized): use a sample split to estimate an approximation error ε between the linear-in-terms model and a richer benchmark, then plug ε into the approximate SD targets.
   - Empirical [RMSE](readable/jargon_rmse.md)s vs target-human-population [L2](readable/jargon_l2.md) bounds are not linked: the proof uses target-human-population [L2](readable/jargon_l2.md) distances under `ν_pop`, but the R workflow computes test-set [RMSE](readable/jargon_rmse.md)s. A generalization/[LLN](readable/jargon_lln.md) step is needed to show the sample RMSE converges to the target-human-population `L2(ν_pop)` distance (or to a weighted target-human-population target), and then thread that into the [L2](readable/jargon_l2.md)-approximation assumptions used in the bounds.
   - Component [SD](readable/jargon_standard_deviation.md) targets require an [additive-projection](readable/jargon_additive_projection.md) definition to separate estimation error from approximation error (projection residual size).

2) Missingness and “not sure” responses are not modeled
   - The formalized outcomes are bounded real values on [0,100] and do not model the “not sure” response option or any missingness mechanism.
   - To fix: justify treating “not sure” as ignorable, or add a missingness/selection model and connect it to the [estimands](readable/jargon_estimand.md).
   - Patch plan (MAR/MCAR): (i) introduce a missingness indicator `R` and observed outcome `Yobs := if R=1 then Y else default`, plus a notation that treats “not sure” as `R=0`; (ii) add a bundled assumption in `ConjointSD/Assumptions.lean` for MCAR (`R ⟂ (Y, A, X)` with `P(R=1)>0`) or MAR (`R ⟂ Y | (A, X)` with positivity `P(R=1 | A, X) >= c`); (iii) show the target estimand is identifiable from observed data under MAR by rewriting expectations as `E[Y | A, X] = E[Yobs | A, X, R=1]` and then integrating over `(A, X)`; (iv) update the estimator definitions to either (a) treat missing as ignorable and use complete cases under MCAR, or (b) add inverse-probability weights `1/P(R=1 | A, X)` under MAR; (v) thread the new assumptions into the consistency theorems by replacing outcome integrability with conditional integrability given `R=1`, and adding the positivity bound needed for LLN/variance control; (vi) update docs (`readable/Assumptions.md`, any affected `readable/*.md`, `proven_statements.md`, `gaps.md`) and rerun the dependency tables.
