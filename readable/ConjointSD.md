# ConjointSD.lean

Lean file: [ConjointSD.lean](../ConjointSD.lean)

This is the top-level import file for the project. It does not define new theorems.

What it does:
- Imports all of the project modules in a single place.
- Lets users load the entire development by importing `ConjointSD`.

So this file is the entry point that gathers everything together.
