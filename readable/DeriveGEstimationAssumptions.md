# DeriveGEstimationAssumptions.lean

Lean file: [ConjointSD/DeriveGEstimationAssumptions.lean](../ConjointSD/DeriveGEstimationAssumptions.lean)

This file is deprecated. The main chain now uses `attrMean_tendsto_of_theta_tendsto` and
`attrM2_tendsto_of_theta_tendsto` directly from `ConjointSD/RegressionConsistencyBridge.lean`.

This module now contains no additional lemmas.

In short, the file is a thin wrapper: it reuses the more general [bridge](jargon_bridge.md) theorem and specializes it to the paper-friendly form.
