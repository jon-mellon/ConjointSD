# Scratch.lean

Lean file: [Scratch.lean](../Scratch.lean)

This is a scratchpad file. It imports the full project and prints the types of key assumptions and theorems (including derived integrability lemmas, intermediate consistency results, and paper-facing wrappers) for inspection. The list includes the design-derived OLS moment package (`paper_ols_attr_moments_of_design_ae`), the end-to-end transport wrapper (`paper_sd_total_sequential_consistency_to_true_target_ae_of_paper_ols_design_ae_of_NoInteractions_of_randomization`), the new moment-convergence bridges from raw parameter convergence (`attrMean_tendsto_of_theta_tendsto`, `attrM2_tendsto_of_theta_tendsto`, `olsThetaHat_tendsto_of_moment_assumptions`, `olsThetaHat_tendsto_of_moment_assumptions_id`, `olsThetaHat_tendsto_of_attr_moments`), and the bounded-feature continuity derivations (`functionalContinuity_gLin_of_bounded`, `functionalContinuity_gTotalΘ_of_bounded`). It also prints the design-side inverse‑Gram and identification derivations (`paper_ols_gramInv_tendsto_of_design_ae`, `paper_ols_theta0_eq_of_normal_eq`) and the normal-equation derivation from well-specification (`paper_ols_normal_eq_of_wellSpecified`) alongside the paper OLS convergence bridge (`theta_tendsto_of_paper_ols_design_ae`). It now appends an auto-generated block of all theorems defined in `ConjointSD/` so the dependency DAG includes every intermediate node.

It does not define new logic. It is used to quickly check the shapes of assumptions and results in Lean.
