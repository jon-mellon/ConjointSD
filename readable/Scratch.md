# Scratch.lean

Lean file: [Scratch.lean](../Scratch.lean)

This is a scratchpad file. It imports the full project and prints the types of key assumptions and theorems (including derived integrability lemmas, intermediate consistency results, and paper-facing wrappers) for inspection. The list now includes the score-based mean LLN lemma `meanHatZ_tendsto_ae_of_score`.

It does not define new logic. It is used to quickly check the shapes of assumptions and results in Lean.
