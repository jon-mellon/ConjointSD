# Scratch.lean

Lean file: [Scratch.lean](../Scratch.lean)

This is a scratchpad file. It imports the full project and prints the types of key assumptions and theorems (including derived integrability lemmas, intermediate consistency results, and paper-facing wrappers) for inspection. The list includes the design-derived OLS moment package (`paper_ols_attr_moments_of_design_ae`), the design-based block/total and total-only sequential-consistency wrappers (`paper_sd_blocks_and_total_sequential_consistency_ae_of_paper_ols_design_ae`, `paper_sd_total_sequential_consistency_ae_of_paper_ols_design_total_ae`), the new moment-convergence bridges from raw parameter convergence (`attrMean_tendsto_of_theta_tendsto`, `attrM2_tendsto_of_theta_tendsto`), and the bounded-feature continuity derivations (`functionalContinuity_gLin_of_bounded`, `functionalContinuity_gTotalΘ_of_bounded`, `functionalContinuity_gBlockTerm_of_bounded`). It also prints the new design-side inverse‑Gram, orthogonality/positive‑definiteness‑to‑full‑rank, and identification derivations (`paper_ols_gramInv_tendsto_of_design_ae`, `paper_ols_fullRank_of_orthogonal`, `paper_ols_fullRank_of_posDef`, `paper_ols_theta0_eq_of_normal_eq`) and the normal-equation derivation from well-specification (`paper_ols_normal_eq_of_wellSpecified`).

It does not define new logic. It is used to quickly check the shapes of assumptions and results in Lean.
