# Scratch.lean

Lean file: [Scratch.lean](../Scratch.lean)

This is a scratchpad file. It imports the full project and prints the types of key assumptions and theorems (including intermediate consistency results and paper-facing wrappers) for inspection.

It does not define new logic. It is used to quickly check the shapes of assumptions and results in Lean.
