# VarianceDecompositionFromBlocks.lean

Lean file: [ConjointSD/VarianceDecompositionFromBlocks.lean](../ConjointSD/VarianceDecompositionFromBlocks.lean)

This file proves a [variance](jargon_variance.md) decomposition for a sum of [block](jargon_block.md) scores.

Key definitions:
- `gTotal`: sums all [block](jargon_block.md) scores to get the total score.

This file currently provides the core definition for the total score, but no top-level theorem is exposed.
