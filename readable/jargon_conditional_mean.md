# Conditional mean

Lean entrypoint: [ConjointSD.lean](../ConjointSD.lean)

A conditional [mean](jargon_mean.md) is an average computed after restricting to a subset of the [population](jargon_population.md), such as "the average outcome among those with [profile](jargon_profile.md) x." In these files it is written using an [integral](jargon_integral.md) over a restricted [distribution](jargon_distribution.md).
