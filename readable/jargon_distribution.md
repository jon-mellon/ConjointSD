# Distribution (also called a measure)

Lean entrypoint: [ConjointSD.lean](../ConjointSD.lean)

A distribution tells you how likely different outcomes are. In this project, it is used to say things like "the attributes are drawn from nu" or "A 0 has distribution nu."

When the distribution is a probability distribution, the total probability of all possible outcomes is 1.
