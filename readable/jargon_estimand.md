# Estimand

An estimand is the target quantity a statistical procedure aims to learn, such
as a target human population [mean](jargon_mean.md), [standard deviation](jargon_standard_deviation.md),
or a causal function like `gStar`. It is distinct from an
[estimator](jargon_estimator.md), which is the data-based rule used to
approximate it.
