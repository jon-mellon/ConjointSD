# Law of large numbers (LLN)

The law of large numbers says sample averages converge to the population
[mean](jargon_mean.md) as sample size grows. The strong law (SLLN) is almost
everywhere convergence; the weak law is convergence in probability. In this
project it is used to move from empirical moments to population moments.
