# Law of large numbers (LLN)

The law of large numbers says sample averages converge to the underlying
[distribution](jargon_distribution.md) [mean](jargon_mean.md) as sample size
grows. The strong law (SLLN) is almost everywhere convergence; the weak law is
convergence in probability. In this project it is used to move from empirical
moments to design-distribution moments and, via transport, to attribute-distribution
moments for the target human population.
