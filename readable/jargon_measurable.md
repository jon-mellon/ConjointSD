# Measurable

Lean entrypoint: [ConjointSD.lean](../ConjointSD.lean)

A function is measurable if it is well-behaved enough to be used inside [integrals](jargon_integral.md) and probability statements. It is a technical condition that lets theorems about [averages](jargon_mean.md) and probabilities apply.
