# Population (vs sample)

Lean entrypoint: [ConjointSD.lean](../ConjointSD.lean)

The population is the full [distribution](jargon_distribution.md) of units you care about. A sample is the finite data you observe. Population quantities are defined using the population distribution; sample quantities are computed from the observed data.
