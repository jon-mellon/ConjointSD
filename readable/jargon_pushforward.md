# Pushforward

Lean entrypoint: [ConjointSD.lean](../ConjointSD.lean)

The pushforward of a measure by a measurable function is the induced distribution of the function’s output. If `A 0` is a random draw under `μexp` (experiment) or `ρ` (evaluation), then `Measure.map (A 0) μexp` or `Measure.map (A 0) ρ` is the pushforward law of attributes.
