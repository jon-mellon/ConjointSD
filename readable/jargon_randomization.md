# Randomization

Lean entrypoint: [ConjointSD.lean](../ConjointSD.lean)

Randomization means the assignment mechanism is generated from [random variables](jargon_random_variable.md)
that are [independent](jargon_independent.md) of the relevant [potential outcomes](jargon_potential_outcome.md).
This is the core assumption behind randomized assignment in experiments.
