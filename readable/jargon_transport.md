# Transport (external validity)

Lean entrypoint: [ConjointSD.lean](../ConjointSD.lean)

Transport means the experimental score matches the target [population](jargon_population.md)
score on the [population support](jargon_population_support.md), typically
[almost everywhere](jargon_almost_everywhere.md) under the target distribution.
It is the external-validity step that lets experimental conclusions apply to the target population.
