# Weighting (reweighting)

Lean entrypoint: [ConjointSD.lean](../ConjointSD.lean)

Weighting means using a weight function to adjust evaluation-sample averages so they match
target [population](jargon_population.md) moments, such as the [mean](jargon_mean.md) and
[second moment](jargon_second_moment.md).
