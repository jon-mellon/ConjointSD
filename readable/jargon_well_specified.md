# Well-specified

Lean entrypoint: [ConjointSD.lean](../ConjointSD.lean)

A model is well-specified if it exactly matches the true causal target it is meant to represent. In this project, that means the [linear model](jargon_linear_model.md) equals the causal score function for all [profiles](jargon_profile.md).
